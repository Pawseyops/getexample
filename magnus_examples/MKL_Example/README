# Math Kernel Library (MKL) Sample Program - (Real/Complex)
#
# README
##

The examples only work for MKL version 10.3. Please, do

module load MKL/10.3

before you work on them.

For an example using the MKL library with double precision complex matricies
and vectors see the "Complex/" diretory.

For an example using double precision reals see the "Real/" directory.

For an Iterative Sparse Solver example using the Conjugate Gradient Solver see
the "SparseSolve/" directory.

Consult the "Complex/README", "Real/README" or "SparseSolve/README" for
compilation instructions.
