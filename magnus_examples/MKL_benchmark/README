# This is a simple fortran file that does a linear solve on a dense 8000x800
# matrix, and computes the residual of the solution to check that the answer 
# is correct (at least to within machine precision).

# to compile using the (sequential) MKL Libraries:
echo "=== compiling/linking to MKL library ==="
module purge
module load GNU MKL
make -f makefile.mkl clean
make -f makefile.mkl


# and the time:
echo "=== timing linear solve using MKL library ==="
time ./linear_solve_mkl.exe 

# now, compile using the BLAS libraries
echo "=== compiling/linking to BLAS/LAPACK library ==="
module purge
module load GNU LAPACK BLAS
make -f makefile.lapack clean
make -f makefile.lapack

# and time
echo "=== timing linear solve using BLAS/LAPACK library ==="
time ./linear_solve
