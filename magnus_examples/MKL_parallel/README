# This is a simple C file that multiplies two 6000x6000 matrices together

# to compile using the MKL Libraries:
echo "=== compiling/linking to MKL library ==="
module purge
module load GNU MKL
make -f makefile.mkl clean
make -f makefile.mkl


# and the time single threaded
echo "=== timing linear solve using MKL library ==="
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1

# and the time multi-threaded
echo "=== timing linear solve using MKL library ==="
