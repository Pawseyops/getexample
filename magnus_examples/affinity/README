# Simple examples on how to set the affinity for a job.  There are two ways that this is supposed to work:
#
# 1- Use taskset to run the job (affinityTest.qsub)
# 2- Use taskset to change the affinity of the job (affinityTest_change.qsub)
#
# Currently only the affinityTest.qsub test is working. Not sure why we can not change affinity after a task is running.

make
qsub affinityTest.qsub
