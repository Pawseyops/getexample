# Example OBjECTIVE: to demostrate omp_hello.c example on Magnus
# on the GNU environment. omp_hello.c is an OpenMP code 
# and restricted to a single node.
# omp_hello.c is taken from 
# https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/exercise.html
# To run this code, we need to specify the number of tasks
# and the number of OpenMP threads.
# This information is located under hello_omp_gnu.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_omp_gnu.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 1 node (--nodes=1)
# To compile the code with GNU, we swap from Cray
# environment to GNU as shown below:
# module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
# Then, we set the total number of threads to 24 as shown below:
# export OMP_NUM_THREADS=24
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 1 OpenMP task (-n 1)
# with 24 threads (-d 24)
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like: 
# aprun -n 1 -d 24 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the omp_hello.c code with GNU
cc -O2 -fopenmp omp_hello.c -o hello_omp_gnu

# To submit the job to Magnus
sbatch hello_omp_gnu.slurm
