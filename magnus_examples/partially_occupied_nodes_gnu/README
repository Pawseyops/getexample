# Example OBjECTIVE: to demostrate hello_mpi.f90 example on 
# Magnus on GNU environment with two partially occupied nodes.
# hello_mpi.f90 is an MPI code which runs on 2 nodes
# with 12 MPI tasks on each node.
# hello_mpi.f90 code is taken from
# https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/hello_mpi/hello_mpi.f90
# To run this code, we need to specify the total number of MPI tasks,
# the number of MPI tasks per node
# and the number of MPI tasks per socket.
# This information is located under hellompi_partial_gnu.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hellompi_partial_gnu.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 2 node (--nodes=2)
# To compile the code with GNU environment, we swap
# from Cray environment to GNU as shown below:
# module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
# To launch a job, we specify to aprun 24 MPI tasks (-n 24)
# with 12 MPI tasks per node (-N 12)
# and 6 MPI tasks per socket (-S 6)
# Therefore, the aprun command looks like: 
# aprun -n 24 -N 12 -S 6 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hello_mpi.f90 code on GNU
ftn -O2 hello_mpi.f90 -o hellompi_partial_gnu

# To submit the job to Magnus
