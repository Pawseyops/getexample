# This is a simple C file that multiplies two 6000x6000 matrices together
# to see a speedup, you will need to be on a node with an intel xeon phi,
# e.g., dev-intel14-phi

# to compile using the MKL Libraries:
echo "=== compiling/linking to MKL library ==="
module purge
module load Intel MKL/11.0
make -f makefile.mkl clean
make -f makefile.mkl


# time matrix multiplication with single core
echo "=== timing linear solve using MKL library ==="
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_MIC_ENABLE=0
time ./dgemm_ex.exe  

# and the time offload multiplication
echo "=== timing linear solve using MKL library ==="
export MKL_MIC_ENABLE=1
time ./dgemm_ex.exe
