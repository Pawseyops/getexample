# This is the README file is an executable script.
# To run type: ./README
#
# Example OBjECTIVE: to demostrate hybrid_hello.f90 example
# on Zeus with PGI Compiler. This is a mixed-mode job
# which includes both MPI and OpenMP jobs.
# cp the hybrid_hello.f90 source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/hybrid_hello.f90 .


 
# To run this code load the necessary modules.,
# specify the total number of MPI tasks and
# the number of OpenMP threads.
# This information is located under hello_hybrid_pgi.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_hybrid_pgi.slurm 

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here specify to SLURM that we want 2 nodes (--node=2)

# To run this code correctly on Zeus, 
# we need to remove --export=NONE
# If it is still included in the SLURM, 
# the code does not compile.
# To compile with PGI compiler, we need to unload gcc module
# and load the pgi module as shown below:
module unload gcc
module load  pgi
# Then, we load the other necessary modules before listing.
module load mpt
# This script requires 2 nodes and runs 1 MPI process with
# 16 OpenMP threads on each intel compiled executable.
# Hence, we set the number of threads to 16 as shown below: 
# export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16
# Therefore, the srun command looks like:
# srun --mpi=pmi2 -n 2 -N 2 ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hybrid_hello.f90 code with PGI compiler
pgf90 -Mmpi=sgimpi -mp hybrid_hello.f90 -o hello_hybrid_pgi
