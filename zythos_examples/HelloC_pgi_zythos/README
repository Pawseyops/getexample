# This is the README file is an executable script.
# To run type: ./README
#
# Example OBJECTIVE: to demonstrate helloworld.c example
# on Zythos with PGI compiler. 
# helloworld.c is a simple c code that prints out "Hello World!"
# and runs on a single node. 
# cp the helloworld.c source code
cp $GE_DIR/src/helloworld.c .


# To run this code, we need to specify the number of nodes used
# and edit the partition and load the necessary modules.
# This information is located under helloworld_pgic.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs helloworld_pgic.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 1 node (--ntasks=1)
# We then change the partition to Zythos (--partition==zythos)
# We also edit the account name (--account=pawsey0001)
# If the account name is missing or not entered correctly,
# the SLURM does not run.
# To run this code correctly on Zythos, we need to remove --export=NONE
# If it is still included in the SLURM, the code does not compile
# To compile this code with PGI compiler, we unload the gcc
# module and load the pgi module as shown below:
module unload gcc
module load pgi 
# To run the code, we simply type:
# ./$EXECUTABLE >> {$OUTPUT}

# To compile the helloworld.c with PGI
pgcc -O2 helloworld.c -o helloworld_pgi

# To submit the job to Zythos
sbatch helloworld_pgic.slurm
