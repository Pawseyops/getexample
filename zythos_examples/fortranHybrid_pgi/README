# Example OBjECTIVE: to demonstrate hybrid_hello.f90 example
# on Zythos with PGI Compiler. This is a mixed-mode job
# which includes both MPI and OpenMP jobs.
# To run this code, we need to edit the partition, 
# load the necessary modules,
# specify the total number of nodes, cores per node and
# the number of OpenMP threads.
# This information is located under hello_hybrid_pgi.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_hybrid_pgi.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# We modify the partition to Zythos (--partition==zythos)
# Here specify to SLURM that we want 4 nodes (--ntasks=4)
# We then specify the number of cores for the NUMA region (--cpus-per-task=6)
# We also replace the account name 
# with our own account name (--account=pawsey0001)
# If the account name is missing or not entered correctly,
# the SLURM does not run.
# To run this code correctly on Zythos, we need to remove --export=NONE
# If it is still included in the SLURM, the code does not compile.
# To compile with PGI compiler, we need to unload the gcc module
# and load the pgi module as shown below:
module unload gcc
module load pgi
# Then, we load the necessary modules before module listing.
module load mpt
# We also set the number of threads to 6 as shown below: 
# export OMP_NUM_THREADS=6
# Therefore, the mpirun command looks like:
# mpirun -np 4 omplace -nt $OMP_NUM_THREADS ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}
 
# To compile the hybrid_hello.f90 code with PGI compiler
pgf90 -Mmpi=sgimpi -mp hybrid_hello.f90 -o hello_hybrid_pgi

# To submit the job to Zythos
