# Example OBJECTIVE: to demonstrate hello_world.f90 example 
# with Intel compiler on Zythos.
# hello_world.f90 is a simple FORTRAN code prints "Hello World!" 
# and runs on a single node.
# To run this code, we need to specify the number of nodes used
# and change from GNU compiler to Intel.
# This information is located under hello_fortran_intel.slurm
# You can edit the SLURM as: emacs hello_fortran_intel.slurm &

# SLURM directives
# 
# Here we specify to SLURM we want 1 node (--ntasks=1)
# We then change the partition to zythos (--partition=zythos)
# To run this code correctly, we need to remove --export=NONE
# from the SLURM. If not removed, the code does not compile.
# To compile this code with Intel, we swap
# from GNU to Intel as shown below:
# module unload gcc
# module load intel
# To run the code, we simply type:
# ./$EXECUTABLE >> ${OUTPUT}

# To compile the hello_world.f90 code with Intel
ifort -O2 hello_world.f90 -o hello_fortran_intel

# To submit the job to Zythos
sbatch hello_fortran_intel.slurm
